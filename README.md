## Developing a local driver communication protocol

This is the source code created for the blog post 
[Malware Development â€” Developing A Local Communication Protocol](https://medium.com/@pygrum/malware-development-developing-a-pipe-communication-protocol-d1b15f5312b7).

This project was made purely for educational purposes, and provides an insight into a possible architecture malware may use to establish a communication channel with its C2. I do not condone the illegitimate use of the PoC code from this repository.
