## Developing a local driver communication protocol

This is the source code created for the blog post 
[Malware Development —
 Developing A Local Communication Protocol](Malware Development — Developing A Local Communication Protocol).

This project was made purely for educational purposes, and provides an insight into a possible architecture malware may use to establish a communication channel with its C2. I do not condone the illegitimate use of the PoC code from this repository.
